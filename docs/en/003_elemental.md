# Elemental

A subscription element for use with the [Elemental module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-elemental) is provided.

This allows content authors to add one or more subscription forms to a page's elemental area and configure:

+ submitting with/without redirect
+ the audience (list) used
+ before/after HTML content to render with the form
+ an image to include in the form
